Question 1:
What are the regular expressions involved, and
which semantic values are they associated with?
-
The REG-EX used in the file is ['0'-'9'], and the semantic values for these are the 
numbers from 0 to 9(but only digit).

--------------------------------------

Question 2:
Which additional file is generated during the process? 
-
hello.fs   and    hello.fsi

How many states are there by the automaton of the lexer? 
-
3 states

---------------------------------------

Question 6:
Explain why the results are expected behaviour from the lexer.
-
34 is recognized by the Lexer, because the REG-EX ends with " ['0'-'9']+ ", meaning there has to be 
at least one number, and there can be multible numbers following this. 
Everything before that in the REG-EX is optional, due to the questions mark Symbol.

34.24 is recognized by the Lexer, because the regex starts with ['0'-'9']* meaning 0 or 
more numbers and then a '.' has to follow. After the '.', there has to be one or more numbers
following the '.', because of the " ['0'-'9']+ " clause. 

34,34 is recognized as 34 by the lexer, because it does not recognize the comma as a 
separator of two numbers. Only the '.' can be a separator. Therefore, this input is 
recognized by the last part of the regex " ['0'-'9']+ " which can only read the first
two numbers, and then it stops when it reaches the comma.
