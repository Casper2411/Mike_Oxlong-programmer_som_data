REG EX:
We have assumed that the empty string not is allowed, due to the 
specification that it must consist of the letters A and B.

With these assumptions in mind, we have found the REG-EX:
(A?(B+A?)+)|A


NFA:
From the REG-EX, we have constructed a NFA that is the picture in the folder, 
and the picture is named: NFA.jpg
We have used the method from the book, to convert a REG-EX to a NFA, and then simplified 
the edges. This being that we removed redudant edges, and also combined some Epsilon edges 
with some letters, while still holding the logic of the NFA.


DFA:
From the NFA we have constructed the corresponding DFA to this. This is the picture 
in the folder, and the picture is named: DFA.jpg
To do this, we used the method shown in the lecture, to convert an NFA to a DFA. The skema 
for this conversion is in the picture named: Skema.jpg
