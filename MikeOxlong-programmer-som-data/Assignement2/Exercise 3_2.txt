REG EX:
We have assumed that the empty string not is allowed, due to the 
specification that it must consist of the letters A and B.

With these assumptions in mind, we have found the REG-EX:
(A?(B+A?)+)|A


NFA:
From the REG-EX, we have constructed a NFA is the picture in the folder, 
and the picture is named: NFA.jpg

DFA:
From the NFA we have constructed the corresponding DFA to this. This is the picture 
in the folder, and the picture is named: DFA.jpg
